Experimenting with Ansible.  

This will definitely not be complete for a while. UPDATE: This is actually somewhat complete!! 

Working on creating a fully automated website backup using ansible. UPDATE: now fully automated.  

Hosts file is not currently being tracked. UPDATE: a lot of files not being tracked. There's a .gitignore file that has templates, vars, and my hosts file. 

Please feel free to take a look. Advice/critique welcome. 

Thank you!!
